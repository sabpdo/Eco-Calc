Here is an <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/population_and_sustainability/sustainability/live_more_sustainably.html" target="_blank" title=""> article</a> from the Center for Biological Diversity that teaches how to be more sustainable These ways to be sustainable are as simple as eating less meat, thinking twice before shopping, choosing to have a smaller family, and voting! Or click <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/trump-showerhead-rule-increase-water-flow-dumped-78882649" target="_blank" title=""> here</a> to learn how much water it really takes to make your meat. You'll be surprised by the results unless you already know. </p>
        <p> If you don't already have a solar panel at your house, you should get some. After federal tax incentives, solar panels only cost about $12,000 (for a 6 kW system). <a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/solar-energy/how-much-do-solar-panels-cost.html#:~:text=After%20solar%20tax%20credits%2C%20the%20cost%20for%20a,much%20does%20it%20cost%20to%20install%20solar%20panels%3F" target="_blank" title=""> The average cost per kilowatt hour (kWh) with solar panels is 6-8 cents. <a href="https://www.solar.com/learn/solar-panel-cost/" target="_blank" title=""> Solar Panel Cost (solar.com) </a> On the other hand, it costs an average of 13.19 cents per kWh to have electricity without solar panels. <a href="https://www.electricchoice.com/electricity-prices-by-state/" target="_blank" title=""> Electric Rates by State (electricchoice.com)</a> Using the upper end of 8 cents/kWh with solar panels, it will take about 231,213 kWh for the solar panels to pay for themselves. Given that about <a href="https://www.electricchoice.com/blog/electricity-on-average-do-homes/" target="_blank" title=""> 10,909 kWh</a> is used by the average household per year, at the current rate, it would take 21.19 years for solar panels to pay for themselves. However, prices with solar panels are going down, while prices of grid electricity are going up, so the solar panel price will likely pay off sooner.
