For the HackTable hackathon (July 2021), I along with three other teammates helped code, design, and submit this website. Our project won best website made with Qoom. For more information about what the website does, please go to this link on Devpost:https://devpost.com/software/eco-calc

We used css, javascript, and html. 


Description:
Our project, based on the United Nationâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals 7-15 (omitting 10), Eco-Calc is your go-to calculator for all things sustainable. We differ from our competition by providing a range of sustainability calculators, available to the users by the click of a button. Some of our available calculators include a carbon calculator to discover how much carbon you emit based on a simple quiz and a water usage calculator to see the amount of water you use in a year. We also have a resources page so you can learn how we created the equations that we use in our calculators, as well as an about page to learn more about us. Eco-Calc takes something very challenging, calculating the amount of emissions a person omits a year, and makes it a breeze in a series of easy-to-answer questions. The first step to change is acceptance, so hop on ecocalc.ml today to discover how sustainable you really are!
